# Jellyfinmoreplayer - New Version
This script enables Jellyfin to support external players such as PotPlayer, VLC, IINA, NPlayer, MXPlayer, and Infuse Player.
The implementation is based on and improved from the original script JellyfinMorePlayer https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/481318-jellyfinmoreplayer . We extend our thanks to the original author for their contribution.
